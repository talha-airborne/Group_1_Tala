    "In this preprocessing step, several transformations are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling. Binary categorical features such as `FLAG_OWN_CAR` and `FLAG_OWN_REALTY` are converted from `'Y'` and `'N'` to numeric `1` and `0`, respectively. Invalid entries in the `CODE_GENDER` column (specifically `'XNA'`) are replaced with missing values (`NaN`). For missing occupation information, the category `'Pensioner'` is used as a placeholder, and instances of `'XNA'` in the `ORGANIZATION_TYPE` column are relabeled as `'Retired'`. Additionally, values in the `NAME_FAMILY_STATUS` column are standardized by merging `'marriage'` and `'civil marriage'` into a single `'married'` category. Rows with unusual or unhelpful values in `NAME_TYPE_SUITE` such as `'Other_A'` or `'Other_B'` are removed to reduce noise in the data. The target variable `y` is then reindexed to align with the cleaned feature set `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the cardinality of high-cardinality categorical features, only the ten most frequent values in the `ORGANIZATION_TYPE` and `OCCUPATION_TYPE` columns are retained. Less common entries are grouped under the label `'Other'`. This helps in minimizing overfitting and controlling the dimensionality of the dataset. Subsequently, categorical variables—including contract type, gender, education level, family status, housing type, occupation, and organization type—are one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. The `drop_first=True` parameter is used to prevent multicollinearity by dropping the first level of each categorical variable. Finally, the shapes of the processed feature matrix `X` and the target variable `y` are printed to ensure alignment and completeness before model training."

    "This section creates a set of engineered features to enrich the dataset with more informative signals relevant to creditworthiness and default risk. Several domain-inspired features are calculated using existing columns. For instance, `DEVICE_SCORE` is computed by summing binary indicators of car and real estate ownership, acting as a proxy for economic status. `SIM_STABILITY_YEARS`, derived from the number of days since the last phone change, reflects how stable a borrower’s contact number is, which may correlate with trustworthiness. `CONTACT_DEPTH` aggregates multiple contact flags (such as having a phone, work phone, or email), indicating how reachable and verifiable the individual is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional features include `ID_CHANGE_YEARS` (to capture how recently an ID was issued), `REG_STABILITY_YEARS` (years since address registration), `AGE`, `EMPLOYMENT_YEARS`, and their ratio in `STABILITY_RATIO`, which together signal personal and financial stability. Several financial ratios are also introduced, including `INCOME_ANN_RATIO`, `LOAN_TO_PURCHASE_RATIO`, and `INCOME_TO_CREDIT_RATIO`, which measure a borrower’s repayment ability. A `MOBILITY_INDEX` is calculated based on population density to assess regional risk, and `REGION_QUALITY_SCORE` combines regional client ratings to reflect socio-economic context. To capture geographic inconsistencies that may indicate fraud risk, `ADDRESS_INCONSISTENCY_SCORE` sums several mismatch flags. Lastly, `SOCIAL_DEFAULT_RATIO` evaluates the proportion of defaults within a borrower's social circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining these engineered features, a final feature set is compiled, including selected raw continuous variables (such as income and credit amount) and one-hot encoded categorical variables. The final dataset is then cleaned by replacing infinite values and clipping extreme outliers at the 1st and 99th percentiles for numerical stability in downstream modeling."

    "In this analysis, the dataset is first combined with the target variable `y` to form a unified DataFrame. The `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` column is then segmented into five distinct income brackets: `<=50K`, `50K–80K`, `80K–110K`, `110K–140K`, and `140K+`. This binning allows us to observe how default rates vary across different levels of income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is grouped by these income bins, and for each bin, the total number of cases and the number of defaulters are calculated. The default rate is derived by dividing the number of defaulters by the total observations in each bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the default rates are visualized using a bar plot. This provides an intuitive understanding of whether lower or higher income brackets are associated with higher credit risk, which can inform feature selection or risk stratification strategies in modeling."

The `DEVICE_SCORE` is constructed by summing binary indicators for car ownership (`FLAG_OWN_CAR`) and real estate ownership (`FLAG_OWN_REALTY`). Applicants who own neither receive a score of 0, those who own either a car or a house get a 1, and those who own both get a 2.\n",

    "DEFAULT RATE BY REGION QUALITY\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis investigates whether the perceived quality of a borrower's residential region influences their likelihood of default. A new feature called `REGION_QUALITY_SCORE` is constructed by inverting the existing `REGION_RATING_CLIENT` and `REGION_RATING_CLIENT_W_CITY` values (which typically range from 1 to 3, with 3 being best). By subtracting these ratings from 4 and averaging the two, we create a score where higher values represent poorer region quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting `REGION_QUALITY_SCORE` is then plotted against the default rate using a bar plot. This helps assess whether living in lower-rated regions correlates with higher default risk, providing insight into the geographical risk profile of applicants."

    "This analysis investigates the effect of household dependency on loan default risk. A new feature, `DEPENDENCY_RATIO`, is calculated by dividing the number of children (`CNT_CHILDREN`) by the total number of family members (`CNT_FAM_MEMBERS`). A small constant is added to the denominator to prevent division errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependency ratio is then segmented into five bins: 0–20%, 21–40%, 41–60%, 61–80%, and 81–100%, representing increasing levels of financial burden within a household. A bar plot is used to visualize the average default rate in each bin, helping to determine whether higher dependency correlates with a greater likelihood of default. This can inform risk scoring and model features related to household structure."

    "To assess the predictive strength of each engineered feature, we compute their correlation with the target variable `Y`. Before doing so, the target is realigned to match the shape of the final feature set (`X_final`). One-hot encoded categorical variables are excluded from this analysis to avoid redundancy and clutter.\n",

    "A correlation matrix is computed using Pearson correlation, and the features are sorted based on the absolute correlation values with `Y`. This helps identify which continuous or engineered features are most strongly associated with default behavior.\n",

Positive correlations suggest that higher feature values increase the likelihood of default, while negative correlations imply a protective effect. This analysis is crucial for understanding feature relevance before model training."

    "This section trains a logistic regression model using hyperparameter tuning and a custom classification threshold to handle imbalanced data effectively. A grid search is conducted over different values of the regularization parameter `C` and `class_weight` strategies to find the best model based on cross-validated recall for class 1 (defaulters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best model is identified, it is used to predict probabilities on the test set. Rather than using the default threshold of 0.5, a threshold sweep is performed using the ROC curve to identify the cutoff that maximizes recall while keeping the false positive rate (FPR) below a specified limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected threshold is then applied to generate final binary predictions, ensuring a balance between identifying the maximum number of defaulters (high recall) while minimizing false alarms (FPR). This approach is particularly useful in credit risk settings where missing a defaulter is more costly than a few false positives."

    "\n",
    "This block trains a LightGBM classifier optimized for imbalanced binary classification. First, the ratio of negative to positive samples in the training data is computed to guide the setting of `scale_pos_weight`, which balances the importance of the minority class (defaulters).\n",

    "A randomized hyperparameter search is conducted over a range of tree configurations and class weights. The model is evaluated using the F1 score to balance precision and recall, particularly important when false negatives are costly. After training, predicted probabilities are generated and analyzed via an ROC curve.

    "**CATBOOST MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section uses a custom pipeline to address class imbalance and train a high-performing classifier using CatBoost. `BorderlineSMOTE` is applied within the pipeline to oversample only borderline cases of the minority class (defaults), which can enhance the model’s focus on difficult-to-classify examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is tuned using `RandomizedSearchCV` over a defined hyperparameter space. The search is optimized for the F1 score, which balances precision and recall — a crucial metric in imbalanced binary classification problems. After training, the best model is used to predict outcomes on the test set. Performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and a full classification report, offering insights into the model’s ability to correctly detect defaulters while minimizing false positives."

    "In this section, an XGBoost classifier is trained using a pipeline that includes SMOTEENN, which combines oversampling (SMOTE) and data cleaning (Edited Nearest Neighbors) to handle both class imbalance and noise in the training data. This improves the robustness of the model, particularly for minority class prediction. After fitting the pipeline, predicted probabilities are generated for the test set. Instead of default thresholding, a sweep over 1001 thresholds is performed to find the one that meets a minimum accuracy of 70% while maximizing recall on the defaulting class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the optimal threshold is selected, binary predictions are made, and the model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix and a classification report. This approach ensures that the model is not only accurate but also sensitive to detecting defaulters—critical in financial risk applications."

    "\n",
    "Training is performed using sample weights to further emphasize the minority class. After predicting probabilities, the code searches for a custom classification threshold that achieves at least 70% accuracy while maximizing true positives (i.e., recall on defaulters). If multiple thresholds yield the same number of true positives, the one with the fewest false positives is chosen. The best threshold is applied, and performance is visualized with a confusion matrix and a full classification report. This approach balances the model's predictive power while enforcing strict business constraints around accuracy and false alarms."

    "This block uses Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm, to identify loan defaulters. The model assumes that defaulters behave anomalously compared to the majority of applicants. It is trained only on features (without using the labels) and computes an anomaly score for each observation in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine a suitable classification threshold, a grid search is performed over 500 possible cutoff values. The goal is to find the threshold that ensures at least 75% accuracy while maximizing the true positive rate (recall on defaulters. If no threshold satisfies this constraint, an error is raised. The final results, including the selected threshold, confusion matrix, and classification metrics, are presented. This approach is useful in scenarios where labeled data is limited or where anomaly-based methods provide an alternative to supervised learning."

    "**DUAL AUTOENCODER (MLP) MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach trains two separate autoencoders: one on non-defaulters and another on defaulters. The defaulter data is upsampled to match the size of the non-defaulter set, ensuring balanced training. Each autoencoder learns to reconstruct the feature distribution of its respective class using a symmetric neural network structure with a bottleneck. During testing, both autoencoders attempt to reconstruct every test instance. The mean squared reconstruction error (MSE) is calculated for each. If the defaulter-trained autoencoder achieves lower MSE than the non-defaulter one, the sample is classified as a defaulter — suggesting it is more similar to the defaulter profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-model comparison helps separate borrowers who behave anomalously compared to the majority class. The final performance is presented using a confusion matrix and classification report. This method is useful when class separation is more evident in feature space than in linear decision boundaries."

    "**BALANCED RANDOM FOREST MODEL**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section trains a Balanced Random Forest classifier, a variant of the random forest that automatically balances class weights by undersampling the majority class during each bootstrap sample. This is especially useful in imbalanced classification scenarios such as default prediction. After predicting probabilities on the test set, a custom threshold search is performed. The goal is to identify a cutoff that provides at least 75% accuracy while maximizing recall on defaulters (Recall₁ and ensuring at least one true positive (TP > 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the best threshold is found, it is applied to convert probabilities into class predictions. A confusion matrix and full classification report are displayed to evaluate the model’s performance. This approach combines interpretability and robustness, making it suitable for risk-sensitive applications where both false positives and false negatives must be controlled."
